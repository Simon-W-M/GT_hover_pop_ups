# GT_hover_pop_ups
Playing with GT tables and some CSS to create pop up tool tips.

Uses the balloon https://kazzkiq.github.io/balloon.css/ to create pop ups for hover over items from within a GT table.

Have tweaked the css code to change the z priory to 100.  (This was a stack overflow recommendation from somewhere).

The pop ups work fine in firefox but in chrome and edge they seem limited by their table cell boundrary.

My css skills are next to zero and so have gotten close but just not got past this bit.  

Any help would be appreciated.  

I think pop ups on a GT table in a HTML report could be really useful for things such as explaning trends or KPI construction  etc.
